Compendium Browser is faster and better-behaved;</strong> it no longer loads all the compendia into memory on start-up (which sometimes hung servers because of memory or CPU requirements). Instead, it filters and loads on-demand, as well as giving you a Module Setting to control how many rows are loaded at a time.<br>Changes in v0.4.3:<ul><li>Fixed: Error on dragging item from Compendium Browser (<a href='https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/compendium-browser/issues/9'>Issue #9</a>)</li><li>Fixed: Reset Filters doesn't clear the onscreen filters (<a href='https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/compendium-browser/issues/4'>Issue #4</a>)</li></ul>",
